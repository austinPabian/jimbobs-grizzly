/**
 * There is some subtlety here that is important. If the `.css` file extension is omitted,
 * the file will be parsed as SCSS, and not CSS. A quirk of SCSS is that when you import
 * SCSS that contains `url()` calls (backgrounds, fonts, etc), those paths are resolved
 * relative to the *importing* file. However, relative paths in imported CSS files are
 * resolved relative to the imported file, which is what is typically expected.
 *
 * While you should refrain from modifying files in the vendor dir, commenting out sections
 * is fair game. You should do this for example if the vendored stylesheet includes its own
 * images and references them via `url()`, but you use your own images and and overriding
 * rule in your own styles.
